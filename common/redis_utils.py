    Logs retry information for Redis connection attempts during tenacity retries.
    This function, designed to be used as a callback in tenacity, logs retry-related details
    when attempting to connect to a Redis server.

    Parameters:
    - retry_state (tenacity.RetryCallState): The state information for the current retry operation.

    Logs:
    - If retry_state is not None, it logs information about the Redis connection failure, including the waiting time, attempt number, and maximum attempt number.
    - If retry_state is None, it issues a warning indicating that the retry state or next action is unavailable.

    Usage:
    - Integrate this function as a callback in tenacity.retry to capture and log retry details during Redis connection attempts.

    Asynchronous function to establish a connection to a Redis server based on the provided configuration.

    - config (dict): A dictionary containing the Redis connection configuration, including 'host' and 'port'.

    Raises:
    - ConnectionRefusedError: If the connection to the Redis server is refused.
    - Exception: For any other unexpected errors during the connection attempt.

    This function uses the aioredis library to create an asynchronous connection pool to a Redis server.
    It attempts to connect to the specified host and port, and if successful, verifies the connection with
    a PING command. In case of a refused connection, it raises a ConnectionRefusedError.
    For any other unexpected errors, a generic Exception is raised with an associated error message.
